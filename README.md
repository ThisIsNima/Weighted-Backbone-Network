# Weighted-Backbone-Network
This repository contains the implementation code for the paper titled "The Backbone Network of Dynamic FunctionalConnectivity" by Nima Asadi, Ingrid Olson, and Zoran Obradovic.

The file odered_backbone uses ST_preparation for creating the set of adjacency networks of dynamic functional connectivity, and after preprocessing and calculating the initial values based on the paper, solves the system of N linear equations for optimize_backbone function for the distribution of the Null model.
